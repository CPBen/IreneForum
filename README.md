# IreneForum is a fork of mwForum.

Contributors Are Very Welcome!

Help create a fork of an existing forum with different features.
A forum that is straight forward, functional and attractive.

I have several goals with this project.

1. Build a secure forum software.
   This requires simplifying and removing some extra features.
   A. Use a single database software: PostgreSQL.
   B. Use a single (or small set of) web server: OpenBSD httpd.
   C. Stop using external complex software for JavaScript, OpenID, etc.

2. Use icons, text and layouts that produce a forum for those who want
   a small size or larger for those with vision impairment. The current
   set of icons is extremely tiny, which makes status and choices very
   difficult to see. IMHO, it's ugly right now.

3. Fully document not just installation and usage, but also details about
   how the database is setup and modules work.

4. Learn more Perl OO using existing source code that already works.
   Documentation and tutorials are helpful, but a larger project is
   necessary. Working with this will be both a learning and practical
   project to accomplish. My Perl OO capabilities are poor right now.
